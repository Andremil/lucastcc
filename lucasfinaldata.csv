0,"BACKGROUND: No standard treatment guidelines have been established for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). We aimed to assess the differences in outcomes and prognoses between patients with PPH who underwent surgical and non-surgical treatment.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 230 patients diagnosed with PPH at two referral hospitals between August 2013 and October 2023. The patients were divided into non-surgical (group 1, n = 159) and surgical intervention groups (group 2, n = 71). A subgroup analysis was performed by dividing the surgical intervention group into immediate (n = 45) and delayed surgical intervention groups (n = 26).
RESULTS: Initial lactic acid levels and shock index were significantly higher in group 2 (2.85 ± 1.37 vs. 4.54 ± 3.63 mmol/L, p = 0.001, and 0.83 ± 0.26 vs. 1.10 ± 0.51, p < 0.001, respectively). Conversely, initial heart rate and body temperature were significantly lower in group 2 (92.5 ± 21.0 vs. 109.0 ± 28.1 beat/min, p < 0.001, and 37.3 ± 0.8 °C vs. 37.0 ± 0.9 °C, p = 0.011, respectively). Logistic regression analysis identified low initial body temperature, high lactic acid level, and shock index as independent predictors of surgical intervention (p = 0.029, p = 0.027, and p = 0.049, respectively). Regarding the causes of PPH, tone was significantly more prevalent in group 1 (57.2% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.002), whereas trauma was significantly more prevalent in group 2 (24.5% vs. 39.4%, p = 0.030). Group 2 had worse overall outcomes and prognoses than group 1. The subgroup analysis showed significantly higher rates of uterine atony combined with other causes, hysterectomy, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in the delayed surgical intervention group than the immediate surgical intervention group (42.2% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.027; 51.1% vs. 73.1%, p = 0.049; and 17.8% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.018, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PPH presenting with increased lactic acid levels and shock index and decreased body temperature may be surgical candidates. Additionally, immediate surgical intervention in patients with uterine atony combined with other causes of PPH could improve prognosis and reduce postoperative complications.","['Jung YW', 'Kim J', 'Shin WK', 'Song SY', 'Choi JS', 'Hyun SH', 'Ko YB', 'Lee M', 'Kang BH', 'Kim BY', 'Min JH', 'In YN', 'Jung SM', 'Oh SK', 'Yoo HJ']","{'D019344': {'substance_name': 'Lactic Acid', 'registry_number': '33X04XA5AT'}}","Jung YW, et al.

1,"INTRODUCTION: Uterine compressive sutures are conservative measures applied in cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage unresponsive to uterotonics. Pereira's suture was introduced in 2005 and consists of two longitudinal and three transverse non-transfixes sutures. Previous studies reported favorable results, highlighting its benefits and value. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, complications, and impact on fertility and future pregnancies of Pereira's suture applied in cases of uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage.
METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed by consulting the medical records of women treated with Pereira's compressive sutures in a tertiary center between January 2013 and December 2022. We registered demographic data, pregnancy outcomes, short-term complications, and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies.
RESULTS: A total of 50 women were treated with Pereira's suture. The overall success rate was 96% and no hysterectomies were performed. Women who had sutures performed during an intra-cesarean section had better outcomes than those who had an after-cesarean section. Complications were reported in 12% (n = 6) of women, with the most frequent being pelvic infection (n = 3) and abdominal pain (n = 3). Regarding fertility, all women desiring a future pregnancy (n = 5) were able to conceive, resulting in three live births.
CONCLUSION: Pereira's suture is a type of suture that provides numerous advantages and should be considered when first-line medical treatment fails. When applied at an early stage, the sutures may prevent maternal morbidity. The Alcides Pereira's suture is a safe technique and appears to preserve fertility.","['Cordeiro Féria B', 'Nazaré P', 'Figueiredo J', 'Neves Gomes I', 'Pereira A']",{},"Cordeiro Féria B, et al.

2,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of the B-Lynch suture in a case of postpartum hemorrhage of a woman with bicornuate uterus, and to carry out a review of the literature on PPH control strategies in patients with müllerian anomalies, maternal outcomes in terms of hemorrhage control, as well as early and late complications.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Case report of a patient with bicornuate uterus who presented to a regional referral hospital with postpartum hemorrhage following a cesarean section, which was successfully controlled using the B-Lynch suture. A search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar and LILACS databases. The MeSh terms used were: “Uterine Atony,” “Postpartum Hemorrhage,” “Immediate Postpartum Hemorrhage,” “Bicornuate Uterus,” “Müllerian Anomalies,” “Müllerian Duct Abnormalities”. Case reports and case series of patients with müllerian malformations and PPH not responding to initial pharmacological management in whom conservative surgical procedures were used to control bleeding were included. A narrative analysis of the findings was carried out based on study characteristics, techniques used and complications.
RESULTS: Five studies were selected, 4 case reports and 1 case series which included 12 women with uterine malformations who developed PPH and in whom surgical management (uterine compression sutures) or devices (intrauterine balloon) were used for hemorrhage control. Bleeding was successfully controlled in 11 cases, with hysterectomy required only in one case (8.3 %). No long-term complications were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The literature on PPH management in women with müllerian uterine malformations is limited to case reports in which either compression sutures or medical devices such as intrauterine balloons were used. The B-Lynch-type compression suture appears to be a good option for controlling PPH in these women in order to preserve fertility, with a low rate of complications. Further documentation of these types of cases is needed in order to build the evidence regarding the usefulness of this technique for controlling postpartum uterine bleeding in this population.","['Rueda-Monsalbe A', 'Sanabria-Castelblanco JE', 'Montañez-Aldana MÁ']",{},"Rueda-Monsalbe A, et al.

3,"OBJECTIVES: To present a case of uterine necrosis following hemostatic suturing to control postpartum bleeding, and to review the literature in order to identify the suture techniques employed, clinical findings, diagnostics and treatment in the clinical cases described.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 34-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain eight days after cesarean delivery due to placenta previa who required B-Lynch compression suture due to uterine atony, and who was diagnosed with uterine necrosis. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with a satisfactory recovery. A systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline vía Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science databases. The search included case series and reports, and cohorts of women with uterine necrosis following the use of uterine compression sutures for postpartum bleeding. The analysis included sociodemographic and clinical variables at the time of diagnosis, suturing technique, diagnostic tests and treatment.
RESULTS: Overall, 23 studies with 24 patients were included. Of all necrosis cases, 83% occurred following cesarean section. B-Lynch was the suturing technique most frequently used (66 %), followed by the Cho suture (25 %). The most frequent symptoms were fever and abdominal pain. The most commonly used diagnostic test was computed tomography (9/24 cases). Hysterectomy was performed in the majority of cases (75 %).
CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, uterine wall necrosis is a serious complication. It would be advisable to design follow-up cohort studies of women undergoing these procedures in order to determine the incidence of associated complications.","['García-Guerra R', 'Assaf-Balut M', 'El-Bakkali S', 'Pérez de Ávila-Benavides I', 'Huertas-Fernández MÁ']","{'D006490': {'substance_name': 'Hemostatics', 'registry_number': '0'}}","García-Guerra R, et al.

4,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum hemorrhage is a main cause of maternal mortality worldwide, with rising incidence, thus demanding new treatment approaches. Intrauterine balloon systems with application of intrauterine vacuum are a promising new method.
METHOD: All women treated with vacuum-induced tamponade using a modified balloon system were included in this single-center study. Aiming to reduce uterine size for control of postpartum hemorrhage, the intrauterine balloon was filled to 50-100 mL and connected to a vacuum device. Success rate of vacuum-induced tamponade, defined as no need for additional interventional treatment, was analyzed by etiology of postpartum hemorrhage and time period of use.
EXPERIENCE: Vacuum-induced tamponade was applied in 66 women. Success rate was 86% in women with uterine atony (n=44) and 73% in women with postpartum hemorrhage due to placental pathology (n=22). Success rate improved over the study period, culminating in a success rate of 100% in women with postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony in the second half of the observation period (n=22).
CONCLUSION: This observational study supports our pathophysiologic understanding of uterine atony: to treat an atonic uterus, uterine volume must be reduced, leading to coiling of the uterine spiral arteries and, hence, reduced blood loss.","['Haslinger C', 'Weber K', 'Zimmermann R']",{},"Haslinger C, et al.

5,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate uterine tamponade devices' effectiveness for atonic refractory postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) after vaginal birth and the effect of including them in institutional protocols.
SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, POPLINE, from inception to January 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomised and non-randomised comparative studies.
OUTCOMES: Composite outcome including surgical interventions (artery ligations, compressive sutures or hysterectomy) or maternal death, and hysterectomy.
RESULTS: All included studies were at high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence was rated as very low to low. One randomised study measured the effect of the condom-catheter balloon compared with standard care and found unclear results for the composite outcome (relative risk [RR] 2.33, 95% CI 0.76-7.14) and hysterectomy (RR 4.14, 95% CI 0.48-35.93). Three comparative studies assessed the effect of including uterine balloon tamponade in institutional protocols. A stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial suggested an increase in the composite outcome (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.07-15.58) and unclear results for hysterectomy (RR 4.38, 95% CI 0.47-41.09) with the use of the condom-catheter or surgical glove balloon. One non-randomised study showed unclear effects on the composite outcome (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-1.03) and hysterectomy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.04-5.38) after the inclusion of the Bakri balloon. The second non-randomised study found unclear effects on the composite outcome (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.32-2.81) and hysterectomy (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.44-7.69) after the inclusion of Ebb or Bakri balloon.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of uterine tamponade devices for the management of atonic refractory PPH after vaginal delivery is unclear, as is the role of the type of device and the setting.

A systematic review of relevant literature sources was performed. Results-our search revealed 813 literature sources. A total of 15 randomized clinical trials, comparing different doses of oxytocin bolus and infusion used after caesarean delivery have met the selection criteria. Conclusion-oxytocin bolus 0.5-3 UI is considered an effective prophylactic dose. Recommended effective prophylactic oxytocin infusion dose is 7.72 IU/h, but it is unanswered whether we really need a prophylactic infusion of oxytocin if we choose effective bolus dose size and rate. Adverse hemodynamic effects were observed when a 5 UI oxytocin bolus was used. However, topics such as bolus dose size, infusion dose size and requirement as well as bolus injection rate, still remain unanswered.

7,"IMPORTANCE: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an emergent obstetric complication and the leading cause of maternal mortality. Pelvic arterial embolization (PAE) is an effective treatment for intractable PPH. However, a unique protocol has not been accepted in obstetrical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate its efficiency, safety, complications, and outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of PAE for PPH in the literature.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Medline, the database of abstract of reviews, the index to allied health literature, and the Chinese database Sino-Med were searched on March 31, 2020, for studies on PAE for PPH. The data for PAE indication, agents, arteries, success rate, complications, and outcomes were extracted and syncretized for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: From 1075 identified articles, 113 abstracts or full articles were retrieved and 43 studies were finally identified as meeting the including criteria. The results demonstrated that the indications for PAE were as follows: uterine atony, placental abnormality, delivery tract injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, arteriovenous malformation, and vaginal hematoma. The embolization agents mostly in order were gelatin sponge particles, polyvinyl alcohol particles, Gelfoam, N-butyl cyanoacrylate, microcoil, and glue; for arteries, they were mostly uterine artery and internal iliac artery. The clinical success rate was 90.5%, whereas the technical success rate was 99.3%. The most common complications of PAE were postembolization syndrome and menstrual abnormality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The emergent PAE is a safe and effective method with high success rate in life-threatening PPH management. Gelatin sponge granules measuring 500 to 1000 μm in diameter have safe results. Pelvic arterial embolization may affect the recovery of menses and increase PPH in the subsequent pregnancy, but there was no noted correlation with fetal growth restriction.","['Zhang XQ', 'Chen XT', 'Zhang YT', 'Mai CX']",{},"Zhang XQ, et al.

8,"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine balloon tamponade (IUBT) and compression sutures have been widely used in recent years in the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). However, there is scant literature directly comparing the clinical scenarios that led to the discriminant selection of these management modalities and the direct clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study is to compare the patient characteristics and clinical risk factors that led to the use of IUBT and compression sutures in the management of major PPH as well as the immediate outcome in a retrospective cohort.
METHODS: Patients who had IUBT or compression sutures applied due to major PPH (>1000 ml) from 2014 to 2018 in a single obstetric unit were recruited. The patient characteristics and clinical outcome of the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 67 patients had IUBT and 29 patients had compression sutures applied as the first uterine sparing technique. Apart from more vaginal deliveries (25.4% vs. 3.5%) in the IUBT group compared to compression sutures, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of patient characteristics. The IUBT group had a slightly higher blood loss at the start of the uterine sparing procedure (239 ml, p = 0.049) and received more transfusions, despite no differences in the total blood loss, hemogloblin level, incidence of coagulopathy, and intensive care unit admission between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the overall success rate between IUBT and compression sutures to control PPH without additional surgical intervention or hysterectomy (73.1% vs. 55.1%, p = 0.15) or the success rate for PPH due to uterine atony (32.8% vs. 20.7%), though IUBT apparently performed better than compression sutures in cases of placenta praevia (77.3% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.01). Blood loss &gt; 1.5 l at the start of the procedure, presence of placenta accreta, and presence of coagulopathy were found to be significant poor prognostic factors for both procedures to control PPH.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no dominating patient characteristics that favoured the selection of either IUBT or compression sutures in the management of severe PPH except for the mode of delivery. Both procedures had equally high overall success rates to control PPH, but IUBT performed better in placenta praevia cases as compared to compression sutures.","['Kong CW', 'To WWK']",{},Kong CW and To WWK.

9,"Intrauterine balloon tamponade (IUBT) is an established fertility-sparing and life-saving treatment for postpartum haemorrhage. However, high-level evidence is lacking for specific aspects of its use. Our aim was to evaluate a large case series of IUBT to inform evidence-based clinical practice. 296 cases of IUBT over a three-year period at a tertiary obstetric referral centre were identified and reviewed. Demographic, clinical, and procedural outcome measures were collected; including rates of success and failure of IUBT, duration of tamponade, and complications. IUBT was successful in 265 (90%) of women and failed in 18 (6%). All failures occurred within six hours of balloon insertion. Once deemed stable and successful at six hours, no women required return to theatre or further intervention. The mean duration of intrauterine balloon tamponade was 18.5 hours. A large variance in clinical practice exists including duration of intrauterine balloon tamponade, and method and timing of removal. A number of changes informed by the results will be introduced and prospectively audited to improve IUBT use.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Intrauterine balloon tamponade (IUBT) is an important second-line treatment option in severe postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). IUBT is easy to use, is effective especially in the setting of uterine atony, and is associated with minimal complications.What the results of this study add? This study confirms the high rate of success for IUBT in controlling PPH. We found that after six hours, if deemed successful, it is rare that further intervention is required. In addition, tamponade beyond 12 hours, gradual or incremental deflation of the balloon, and antibiotic cover beyond the duration of tamponade are unlikely to yield any further safety benefit.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Our findings suggest that women should not be required to fast for balloon removal; removal of the balloon should occur by 12 hours if deemed stable and adequately resuscitated; deflation and removal of the balloon can occur at once; and antibiotics should be ceased after balloon removal. These will allow women to mobilise and recover sooner, and improve flow and throughput in our high-acuity care areas.","['Dorkham MC', 'Epee-Bekima MJ', 'Sylvester HC', 'White SW']",{},"Dorkham MC, et al.

10,"INTRODUCTION: Postpartum haemorrhage is still the main cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Many treatments are available, but they may threaten fertility potential. As a uterine sparing procedure, we aimed to review uterine compression sutures in order to better understand when they should represent an appropriate option.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive search in MEDLINE and PubMed databases including the terms 'postpartum haemorrhage' and 'uterine compression sutures' was performed. Results were revised and articles reviewing or presenting case reports of uterine compression sutures to treat postpartum haemorrhage were included.
RESULTS: The first description of uterine compression sutures to control postpartum haemorrhage was published in 1997, by B-Lynch et al. After this publication, many others have reported successful management of postpartum haemorrhage with different suturing techniques. Most of them describe success rates above 75% and the possibility of fertility preservation, with cases of uneventful pregnancy after uterine compression sutures already published. Complications associated with each technique are rare.
DISCUSSION: Reports of use of uterine compression sutures include small series of cases or even single case reports which limits the quality of existing evidence to support one technique over another. Nevertheless, uterine compression sutures are recognized as an effective surgical conservative strategy to control postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony and its use is recommended, if possible, prior to hysterectomy.
CONCLUSION: Uterine compression sutures are effective, safe and simple to perform in an emergent situation and preserve fertility potential in cases of postpartum haemorrhage.","['Moleiro ML', 'Braga J', 'Machado MJ', 'Guedes-Martins L']",{},"Moleiro ML, et al.
